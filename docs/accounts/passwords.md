# Passwords

## Password and Account Protection

A user is given a username (also known as a login name) and associated
password that permits her/him to access {{cluster_name}} resources.  This
username/password pair may be used by a single individual only:
*passwords must not be shared with any other person*. Users who
share their passwords will have their access to {{cluster_name}} disabled.

Passwords must be changed as soon as possible after exposure or
suspected compromise.  Exposure of passwords and suspected compromises
must immediately be reported to DST at {{dst_email}}

## Forgotten Passwords

If you forget your password or if it has recently expired, you can
reset your password by contacting a member of the HPC team at {{support_email}}.

## How To Change Your Password in Bright

*  Immediately after someone else has obtained your password (do *NOT*
   give your password to anyone else).
*  As soon as possible, but at least within one business day after a
   password has been compromised or after you suspect that a password
   has been compromised.
*  On direction from DST staff.

Your new password must adhere to DST's password requirements.

## Password Requirements

*   There is no character complexity rule regarding inclusion of
    uppercase/lowercase letters, digits and special characters.
*   Passwords must be changed every 6 months.
  

## Login Failures

Your login privileges will be disabled if you have ten login failures
while entering your password on a {{cluster_name}} resource. You do not need
a new password in this situation. The login failures will be
automatically cleared after 5 minutes. No additional actions are
necessary.
